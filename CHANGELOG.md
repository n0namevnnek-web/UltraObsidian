[breaking changes]
- Dropdown:SetValue selects exactly the requested values that exist, whatever the
  shape (value, { "A", "B" } or { A = true }). A single select given a value that
  isn't in the list is now left empty instead of keeping its old selection, and an
  array given to a multi select no longer keeps values that aren't in the list.
  It returns (applied, unavailable, problem).
- SaveManager loads apply synchronously in the caller's thread (callbacks may
  yield; the load waits) instead of deferring each setting, and return only once
  everything applied. Toggles always apply after every other setting.
- SaveManager loads are snapshots by default: settings the config leaves out go
  back to their defaults. Pass { Mode = "Merge" } or set
  SaveManager.DefaultLoadMode = "Merge" for the old keep-what-is-there behaviour.
  Share codes are always snapshots.

[additions]
+ Dropdown:NormalizeValue(Value) -> (selection, unavailable, problem)
+ Library.OnCallbackError(Error), called for any element callback that errors
+ SaveManager load lifecycle: OnLoadBegin(Context), OnLoadFinish(Context, Report),
  IsLoading(). Covers Load, LoadAutoloadConfig, ImportShareCode, LoadJSON and
  ResetToDefaults (Context.Source says which).
+ SaveManager:ValidateConfig(Content, Options) checks a config without applying it.
  Every load validates the whole config first (entry shapes, types, indexes,
  duplicates, values, compatibility) and changes nothing if it's broken.
+ Loads return (Success, ErrorMessage, Report). Success means every setting and
  callback finished cleanly; the report lists skipped, unavailable, adjusted,
  reset, excluded and migrated entries and any errors. No rollback on failure.
+ SaveManager:SetSelectionResolver(fn) / Options.ResolveUnavailable for
  game-specific fallbacks when a saved dropdown value isn't available.
+ SaveManager:SetShareExclusions({ ... }) and SetShareExcludeFilter(fn): kept out
  of share codes, still saved privately, never applied or reset by an import.
  Inputs holding a URL are excluded automatically (ShareExcludeURLs = true).
+ SaveManager:ImportShareCode(Code, Name) applies a share code and saves it only
  after it fully applied. SaveManager:FormatReport(Report) for notifications.
+ Config format 2: version field, sliders as numbers, dropdowns as arrays, options
  before toggles. Format 1 files load as before and the report notes it.

[fixes]
+ Autosave no longer snapshots or writes while a load is applying.
+ A load that applied with errors detaches the loaded config, so autosave can't
  write the mixed state over it.

[additions]
+ Groupbox:AddStatGrid(Idx, Info) -- a grid of tiles, each a big value over a small
  caption ("61" over "fps", "4 / 20" over "players"). Items are { Value, Text,
  ValueColor, Tooltip }; Columns (3), TileHeight (44) and Padding (6) shape the grid,
  which sizes itself from the tile count. SetValue(Key, Value, ValueColor?) rewrites
  one tile in place, found by position, caption or item table; the element also has
  SetItems, AddItem, UpdateItem, Clear, SetColumns and SetVisible, and is indexed
  into Library.Labels.
+ Buttons option for Library:Notify({ ... }) -- a row of pill buttons under the text,
  each { Text, Func, Close }. Func gets the notification; the notification closes after
  the click unless Close = false, and Callback then sees the reason "button".
```

## 24.09.2026 (2)

```diff
[additions]
+ Groupbox:AddStatusLabel(Idx, Info) -- a scrolling list of rows, each with a live
  status on its right. A row with a Time counts down to that moment ("9 min", "2 hr");
  a row without one, or past it, shows the plain status word ("Up") in accent. Clicking
  any countdown flips the whole list between the countdown and the clock time it lands
  on -- two readings of the same instant, the way a date in a document can be shown
  either way. Rows live in a ScrollingFrame capped at MaxHeight (120 by default), so a
  long list scrolls instead of stretching the groupbox. Items are { Text, Status, Time,
  Suffix, StatusColor, TimeColor, TimeFormat, Tooltip }; the element exposes SetItems,
  AddItem, UpdateItem, Clear, SetMode, Toggle, SetMaxHeight and SetVisible, and is
  indexed into Library.Labels. One heartbeat per list, throttled to a tick a second.
```

## 24.09.2026

```diff
[changes]
* Merged upstream Obsidian (44 commits, through "feat: SetPopOutWidth"). Upstream won
  every API and behaviour conflict; the fork kept its own styling where upstream had
  only restyled the same region. What this changes for callers:
* Library:PlayTabAnimation(Tab, Showing, OnComplete, SwipeFrom) now takes the tab
  table rather than its canvas -- upstream animates Tab.Container and dropped the
  CanvasGroup wrapper around tab contents, which is their fix for blurry tab text. A
  bare container instance is still accepted, so sub tabs pass their own canvas as
  before, and a CanvasGroup container still fades as well as slides.
* Tab buttons gained upstream's ButtonHolder, TabIndicator and TabButtonsStyle. The
  chip skin (Library:SkinTabButton) still owns the corner, the chip and the active
  state, so upstream's own UICorner is not created and CornerRadius has no effect.
  TabButtonsStyle defaults to Gap = 4, Padding = 6 here, which is the spacing the
  skin was drawn against and what keeps MinSidebarWidth at 76.
* Search is upstream's scored implementation: every tab is searched and the window
  switches to the most prominent match. Sub tab recursion and GlobalSearch are kept on
  top -- GlobalSearch now only decides whether tabs other than the best match keep
  their filtered state.
* Tooltips take upstream's cursor-aware placement; the pop animation stays.
* Example.lua is upstream's, pointed back at this fork's raw URL. The fork's own
  element demos are no longer in it.
```

## 21.09.2026 (2)

[changes]
* Reverted the drag gate, the shared element states and the groupbox header
  badge. MakeDraggable is back to moving the window the moment the handle is
  pressed, checkboxes, toggles, buttons and dropdowns keep the state colours
  they each had, and Groupbox:SetBadge / the Badge and ShowActiveCount fields
  are gone again.
* Kept out of that revert: the constants that moved into tables so the main
  chunk clears Luau's 200 local register limit. The Discord card metrics, the
  player card insets and the notification history sizes each live in one table,
  which is what lets the file compile at -O0 the way an executor loads it.
  Anything added near the top level should go in a table for the same reason;
  `luau-compile -O0` is the check, since -O1 and above reuse registers and
  compile a file that is over the limit without complaint.
```

## 21.09.2026

[changes]
* Sliders read as a channel with light in it, and stay flat. The track is sunk to
  the background colour instead of the panel colour and grown 15 -> 18px, and the
  fill runs a gradient along the bar -- shaded at the root, full accent at the head
  -- rather than sitting as one solid block. Nothing rides on the bar: no ball, no
  handle, no rim. Hovering warms the track edge to the accent at 0.4 and that is
  all. Programmatic value changes now glide the fill into place; dragging stays
  glued to the cursor, frame for frame. Compact sliders share the new height, and
  the label gap went 2 -> 3px.
* A tabbox's tab strip is quieter. The recessed rail and the gradient accent chip
  are gone; the row sits flush in the header and the open tab is a soft pill in the
  element colour with the usual outline, sliding between tabs with a short accent
  marker along its bottom edge. The open tab's label and glyph sit at full strength,
  the rest at 0.55, climbing to 0.25 under the pointer. The header divider still
  separates the strip from the content below.
* Nine more pink themes: Cotton Candy, Neon Bubblegum, Rosewater, Strawberry Milk,
  Peony, Magenta Dusk, Pink Lemonade, Hot Pink Void and Orchid Haze -- from a muted
  rosewater through milk-and-strawberry mids to a hot pink on near-black.
```

## 20.09.2026

```diff
[changes]
* Sidebar tab hover is a well at both widths. Expanded rows used to answer a hover by
  lifting the label from 0.5 to 0.25 transparency and nothing else, which is a change
  you have to be looking for; they now raise the same light well the compact column
  does, shaped to the row (the full card, grown back out through the button's padding
  so it covers exactly what the open row's fill covers) and rounded at the bar radius
  rather than the chip's. The compact well was raised from 0.92 to 0.88 so it is
  actually visible, and it swells 24 -> 27px under the pointer the way the chip grows
  when it opens; the wide row sits at 0.94, since a card carries far more light than a
  24px square at the same alpha. Label and glyph now go to 0.1 on hover instead of
  0.25, so the well carries the state and the text only finishes the climb.
* The accent edge marker is drawn at both widths. An expanded open tab was a filled
  card with no accent anywhere on it; the 3x22 rail now lights for it too, which ties
  the expanded row back to the compact chip instead of leaving the two widths looking
  like different controls.
* Sliders are flat again: the label sits above a plain 15px track with the value
  centred inside it. The ball, its shadow, the inner ring and the grey track
  gradient are gone, the bar takes the panel colour rather than the font colour,
  and both bar and fill round at half the window radius instead of into a pill.
  The value now reads "6 studs / 10 studs", spaced either side of the slash.
* Compact sidebar tabs are now dock chips: while the sidebar is compact, the open
  tab's glyph sits on a 30px accent-filled rounded square (a white-to-grey gradient
  over the accent, plus a white top rim) and flips to black or white -- whichever
  reads against the accent. A 3x22 accent marker sits hard against the sidebar's
  left edge, level with the chip, tapering away at both tips. Switching tabs slides
  both: the incoming pair enters from the side the previous tab sits on while it
  fades in, and the outgoing pair leaves towards the new one as it fades out, so the
  mark reads as being carried down the column rather than blinking from place to
  place. Hovering an inactive glyph raises a plain light
  well rather than a faint accent chip, and switching tabs grows the chip from 24px. Expanding the sidebar brings
  the labels back and drops both: a row with a label is a row, not a chip, so the
  button returns to the plain full-width card.
* Compact glyphs sit at 18px (padding 6 -> 11) so they read inside the chip.
* Sidebar tab list gets a 6px gutter with 4px between buttons; minimum sidebar and
  compact widths were nudged up to keep the buttons the same size inside it.

[fixes]
* A chip that had slid away on a tab switch stayed offset, so it was drawn crooked in
  its own button the next time it was hovered. The pair is now put back once the
  slide has finished and it is out of sight.
* Compact chips no longer stay lit as a hover after being selected: Tab:Hover returns
  early while a tab is the open one, so a tab clicked with the pointer on it was never
  told the pointer left and lit back up the moment it was deselected. The chip now
  tracks hover on the button's own signals and drops it on selection.
```

## 02.09.2026

```diff
[changes]
* Groupboxes now slide open/shut when collapsed instead of snapping — the body is
  clipped behind the card edge while the height animates, and the chevron spins with
  it. Gated on Animations.GroupboxCollapse, which defaults to true (independent of
  the general Animations.Groupbox resize flag).

* Tabboxes redesigned: the folder-tab buttons are now a clean icon/text strip with
  a sliding accent underline and a smooth content-switch animation (underline slide
  gated on Animations.SubTabUnderline, content slide on Animations.TabSwitch). Tabbox:AddTab(Name, IconName) — pass a name, an icon, or both ("" name = icon-only).

[fixes]
* Tabbox underline no longer spans the whole strip until the first tab switch: adding
  a tab re-flexes the row, so the underline now re-measures against the active button.

[features]
+ Groupbox:AddDiscordBox(Idx, Info) — a Discord-style promo card: banner, circular avatar overlapping it, status dot, title/subtitle, and a row of action buttons (copy an invite link, run a callback). Nothing is hardcoded — images, colours, labels and actions are all passed in; the accent defaults to Scheme.BlueColor. Methods: SetTitle/SetSubtitle/SetBanner/SetAvatar/SetStatus/SetAccent/SetLink/SetButtons/SetButtonText/SetBannerHeight/SetAvatarSize/SetVisible/GetTotalHeight.
+ Window:SetGlow(Enabled, Options?) — opt-in soft glow behind the window. Off by default and never forced/hidden (games' anticheats can flag unusual rendering). Options: { Color: Color3? (defaults to & follows the accent color), Transparency: number?, Radius: number? }. Also settable at creation via Glow = true.
+ Window:GetSizePosition() / Window:SetSizePosition(Size?, Position?) — read/apply the window size & position (clamped to the viewport & min size, relayouts tabs).
+ SaveManager now saves & restores the UI size and position. Skip it with SaveManager:SetIgnoreIndexes({ "WindowLayout" }).
